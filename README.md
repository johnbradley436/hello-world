# hello-world
A place to keep my things as I learn how all this works

The first thing I'm trying to learn is about editing branches and then committing. It probably turns out I have commitment issues, but we'll see. Ultimately I hope to create a GitHub Pages site, so we'll see what a real tech dunce I am. Hooray!
